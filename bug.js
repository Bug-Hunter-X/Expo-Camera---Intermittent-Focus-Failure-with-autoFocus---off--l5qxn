This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  Specifically, when setting `autoFocus` to `'off'` and trying to manually focus using `focusAsync`, the camera may fail to focus, resulting in blurry images. This doesn't happen consistently, but rather sporadically. The issue is exacerbated when switching between cameras or when the app is in the background and then returns to the foreground.
